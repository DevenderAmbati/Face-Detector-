# Face-Detector-

Created a user-friendly Face Recognition app with ReactJS (front-end) and Node.js (back-end), utilizing a machine learning API.

Employed a full-stack approach, integrating ReactJS for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and PostgreSQL for secure database management. A machine learning API was incorporated to handle the facial recognition tasks.

User-Friendly Interface: Responsive design with ReactJS for an intuitive user experience. Secure Database Management: PostgreSQL ensures safe and efficient data handling. Scalability and Accessibility: Deployed on Heroku Cloud for scalability and global accessibility.
